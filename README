NAME
    Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin - Serve CGIs from root/cgi-bin

SYNOPSIS
    In your controller:

        package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

        use parent qw/Catalyst::Controller::CGIBin/;

    In your .conf:

        <Controller::Foo>
            cgi_root_path    cgi-bin
            cgi_dir          cgi-bin
            cgi_chain_root   /optional/private/path/to/Chained/root
            cgi_file_pattern *.cgi
            # or regex
            cgi_file_pattern /\.pl\z/
            <CGI>
                username_field username # used for REMOTE_USER env var
                pass_env PERL5LIB
                pass_env PATH
                pass_env /^MYAPP_/
            </CGI>
        </Controller::Foo>

DESCRIPTION
    Dispatches to CGI files in root/cgi-bin for /cgi-bin/ paths.

    Unlike ModPerl::Registry this module does _NOT_ stat and recompile the
    CGI for every invocation. This may be supported in the future if there's
    interest.

    CGI paths are converted into action names using "cgi_action".

    Inherits from Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI, see the documentation for
    that module for other configuration information.

CONFIG PARAMS
  cgi_root_path
    The global URI path prefix for CGIs, defaults to "cgi-bin".

  cgi_chain_root
    By default Path actions are created for CGIs, but if you specify this
    option, the actions will be created as Chained end-points, chaining off
    the specified private path.

    If this option is used, the "cgi_root_path" option is ignored. The root
    path will be determined by your chain.

    The PathPart of the action will be the path to the CGI file.

  cgi_dir
    Path from which to read CGI files. Can be relative to "$MYAPP_HOME/root"
    or absolute. Defaults to "$MYAPP_HOME/root/cgi-bin".

  cgi_file_pattern
    By default all files in "cgi_dir" will be loaded as CGIs, however, with
    this option you can specify either a glob or a regex to match the names
    of files you want to be loaded.

    Can be an array of globs/regexes as well.

METHODS
  cgi_action
    "$self->cgi_action($cgi)"

    Takes a path to a CGI from "root/cgi-bin" such as "foo/bar.cgi" and
    returns the action name it is registered as.

  cgi_path
    "$self->cgi_path($cgi)"

    Takes a path to a CGI from "root/cgi-bin" such as "foo/bar.cgi" and
    returns the public path it should be registered under.

    The default is to prefix with "$cgi_root_path/", using the
    "cgi_root_path" config setting, above.

  is_perl_cgi
    "$self->is_perl_cgi($path)"

    Tries to figure out whether the CGI is Perl or not.

    If it's Perl, it will be inlined into a sub instead of being forked off,
    see "wrap_perl_cgi".

  wrap_perl_cgi
    "$self->wrap_perl_cgi($path, $action_name)"

    Takes the path to a Perl CGI and returns a coderef suitable for passing
    to cgi_to_response (from Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI) using
    CGI::Compile.

    $action_name is the generated name for the action representing the CGI
    file from "cgi_action".

    This is similar to how ModPerl::Registry works, but will only work for
    well-written CGIs. Otherwise, you may have to override this method to do
    something more involved (see ModPerl::PerlRun.)

    Scripts with "__DATA__" sections now work too, as well as scripts that
    call "exit()".

  cgi_package
    "$self->cgi_package($action_name)"

    Returns the package name a Perl CGI is compiled into for a given
    $action_name.

  wrap_nonperl_cgi
    "$self->wrap_nonperl_cgi($path, $action_name)"

    Takes the path to a non-Perl CGI and returns a coderef for executing it.

    $action_name is the generated name for the action representing the CGI
    file.

    By default returns something like:

        sub { system $path }
